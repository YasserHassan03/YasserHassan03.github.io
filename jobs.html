            <p>During my time at Phlex, I actively contributed to enhancing the product by rigorously testing its
                features
                and providing detailed feedback to the development team, ensuring continuous improvement and a better
                user
                experience. Additionally, I developed a Django-based dashboard to display live data, which was
                instrumental
                in delivering impactful demonstrations and played a key role in attracting and onboarding new clients.

            <h4>Vice President Aug '24 - Present</h4>
            <h4>Head Coach Oct '23 - Jun '24' </h4>
            <br>
            <p>As head coach of the Imperial College Swim Team, I led engaging training sessions tailored to the diverse
                needs of our 100+ members, ensuring that experienced swimmers were pushed to enhance their endurance and
                fitness while providing essential water safety skills and swimming lessons to beginners. My commitment
                to
                fostering a supportive and high-performance environment was recognized when I was nominated and
                shortlisted
                for the Imperial Athletes Coach of the Year award after just my first full year in the role. Under my
                leadership, the team achieved remarkable success, reaching a national final in my debut year. As VP, I
                secured multiple sponsorship deals with global companies, significantly enhancing team resources
                and visibility, and organized training trips, sessions, and social events that strengthened the sense of
                community within the team.

            <br>
            <p>After being dormant for years, I was part of the committee that revived the society into a thriving, and
                vibrant hub for both social and educational events, with over 100 current members. I was a key voice in
                the
                integration of the society into Huzzle as well as the Arab student union and the MENA careers
                association.

            <h4>Full Stack Engineering Intern</h4>
            <br>
            <p>I spent time building out and developing an internal dashboard for the company, to better help the
                customer
                success team develop reports that they can use in their quarterly meetings with clients as well as
                better
                help the dev team with debugging. I used AWS lambda to write functions in python to extract and format
                data
                from the database before then using typescript, css and html (angular framework) to build out the
                website.
                Later on as the project developed I used the OpenAI API to create AI summaries for each widget in the
                dashboard. </p>
